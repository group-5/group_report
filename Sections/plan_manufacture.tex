    \section{Electronics and control systems}
        \item buy box
        \item Cut holes in electronics housing
        \item Attach the grommets to the electronics housing
        \item Solder spade connectors to the motor cables
        \item Thread all cables through the appropriate holes in the housing and through the nut for the switch
        \item Solder the \SI{2.1}{mm} jack plug to cables
        \item Solder the positive jack plug cable to the switch
        \item Solder the \SI{0}{\volt} jack plug cable and the \SI{0}{\volt} connection of the tamiya connector to the c terminal of the \SI{9}{\volt} battery box
        \item Solder the positive connection of the tamiya connector to the switch
        \item Solder the \SI{9}{\volt} battery box to the switch
        \item Install the \SI{9}{\volt} battery box
        \item Install the switch
        \item Solder the headers to the \gls{servo} \gls{shield}
        \item Connect the \glspl{shield} together and to the \gls{Genuino}
        \item Solder the cables to the \gls{magnetometer} breakout board
        \item Connect the \gls{magnetometer} to the stack of Arduino \glspl{shield}
        \item Cut the VIN and \SI{5}{\volt} pins between the control section and the output section
        \item Screw the stack of Arduino \glspl{shield} and the \gls{magnetometer} to the housing base
        \item Feed the motor and \gls{servo} cables through grommets and attach them to the stack of Arduino \glspl{shield}
        \item Screw the strain relief sections onto the grommets

    \section{Integrating systems}
        \item Attach the base of the electronics housing to the chassis
        \item Attach all connectors to the electronics system
        \item Attach the electronics housing to its base
